# Showing and Running the Nanobot Ops Dashboard

## Project Location

- `/home/ozand/herkoot/Projects/nanobot-ops-dashboard`

## What It Does

The dashboard runs on this host and combines:
- live eeepc self-evolving state over SSH
- local repo-side Nanobot state when available
- historical snapshots stored in SQLite

It is designed so hourly or later state changes can be seen as past snapshots instead of only the latest view.

It also surfaces current blocker analysis for eeepc cycles when the live outbox contains process-reflection data:
- failure class
- blocked next step
- improvement score


The UI also supports simple query-string filtering on history pages:
- `/cycles?source=eeepc&status=BLOCK`
- `/promotions?source=repo&status=accept`

Those filters are also available as visible form inputs on the corresponding pages.

It is designed so hourly or later state changes can be seen as past snapshots instead of only the latest view.

## Important Current Limitation

Durable subagent telemetry is not currently emitted by Nanobot, so the `Subagents` page is implemented but will clearly show that no durable telemetry exists yet.

## One-Time Setup

From the project directory:

```bash
cd /home/ozand/herkoot/Projects/nanobot-ops-dashboard
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m nanobot_ops_dashboard init-db
```

Database path:
- `data/dashboard.sqlite3`

## Collect One Snapshot

```bash
cd /home/ozand/herkoot/Projects/nanobot-ops-dashboard
PYTHONPATH=src NANOBOT_EEEPC_SUDO_PASSWORD='<set-in-shell-or-env-file>' python3 -m nanobot_ops_dashboard collect-once
```

This stores one repo snapshot and one eeepc snapshot.

## Keep History Accumulating

Use the poll loop so new hourly changes continue entering SQLite.

Example with shorter interval for demo:

```bash
cd /home/ozand/herkoot/Projects/nanobot-ops-dashboard
PYTHONPATH=src NANOBOT_EEEPC_SUDO_PASSWORD='<set-in-shell-or-env-file>' NANOBOT_DASHBOARD_POLL_INTERVAL=60 python3 -m nanobot_ops_dashboard poll
```

For testing, you can limit iterations:

```bash
cd /home/ozand/herkoot/Projects/nanobot-ops-dashboard
PYTHONPATH=src NANOBOT_EEEPC_SUDO_PASSWORD='<set-in-shell-or-env-file>' NANOBOT_DASHBOARD_POLL_INTERVAL=1 python3 -m nanobot_ops_dashboard poll --iterations 3
```

## Canonical Long-Running Mode

The project now includes:
- `scripts/run_web.sh`
- `scripts/run_collector.sh`
- `scripts/install_user_units.sh`
- `systemd/nanobot-ops-dashboard-web.service`
- `systemd/nanobot-ops-dashboard-collector.service`

Recommended steady-state setup on this host:
1. create `~/.config/nanobot-ops-dashboard.env`
2. put in at minimum:
   - `NANOBOT_EEEPC_SUDO_PASSWORD=...`
   - optional `NANOBOT_DASHBOARD_POLL_INTERVAL=300`
3. run:

```bash
cd /home/ozand/herkoot/Projects/nanobot-ops-dashboard
./scripts/install_user_units.sh
systemctl --user enable --now nanobot-ops-dashboard-web.service
systemctl --user enable --now nanobot-ops-dashboard-collector.service
```

## Run the Web Dashboard

```bash
cd /home/ozand/herkoot/Projects/nanobot-ops-dashboard
PYTHONPATH=src NANOBOT_EEEPC_SUDO_PASSWORD='<set-in-shell-or-env-file>' python3 -m nanobot_ops_dashboard serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
```

Open:
- `http://127.0.0.1:8787/`

## Pages

- `/` — overview
- `/cycles` — current and historical cycle events
- `/promotions` — repo-side promotion event history
- `/approvals` — latest approval/gate snapshots
- `/deployments` — deployment and verification-related proof fields
- `/analytics` — stored snapshot and cycle summary counters, plus recent snapshots/cycles
- `/subagents` — placeholder page with explicit no-telemetry message
- `/collect` — trigger one immediate collection
- `/api/summary` — machine-readable current summary for scripts or future integrations
- `/api/cycles` — filtered cycle history as JSON
- `/api/promotions` — filtered promotion history as JSON
- `/api/approvals` — approval snapshot JSON
- `/api/deployments` — latest deployment/proof JSON

## What To Show In A Demo

1. Open `/`
   - show current eeepc status
   - show active goal
   - show repo-side promotion summary if present

2. Open `/cycles`
   - show historical collected cycle events
   - explain that new snapshots accumulate in SQLite over time

3. Open `/promotions`
   - show repo-side promotion lifecycle visibility

4. Open `/subagents`
   - explain that the page is ready, but Nanobot does not yet emit durable subagent telemetry

## Test Status

Run all tests:

```bash
cd /home/ozand/herkoot/Projects/nanobot-ops-dashboard
python3 -m pytest -v
```

## Notes

- eeepc collection currently needs sudo because the live authority root is protected.
- the sudo password is passed via `NANOBOT_EEEPC_SUDO_PASSWORD` for local collection.
- repo-side workspace state may be absent on this host; the dashboard handles that gracefully and still shows repo metadata plus live eeepc truth.
