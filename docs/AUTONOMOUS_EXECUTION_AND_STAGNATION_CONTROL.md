# Autonomous Execution and Stagnation Control

Last updated: 2026-04-16 UTC

## Objective

Prevent the Nanobot eeepc project from sitting in a stagnant state while the operator assumes progress is happening.

## Failure We Observed

During the monitored window, the system spent hours in repeated `BLOCK` while:
- the active goal stayed the same
- the live report source stayed the same
- approval remained valid
- no new PASS cycles appeared

This means the failure mode was not infrastructure outage.
It was unattended stagnation.

## Process Changes

### 1. Stagnation is a first-class incident
Treat these as incidents, not passive observations:
- same goal + same report source + `BLOCK` over multiple collections
- no new PASS in a defined window
- repeated `failure_class` such as `no_concrete_change`

### 2. Separate roles explicitly
The system needs three ongoing functions:
- observer: collects and surfaces truth
- diagnostician: identifies blocker class and trend
- executor: takes the next bounded step toward the project goal

The dashboard already covers observer truth.
A supervisor loop must now cover diagnostician escalation.

### 3. Escalation thresholds
Escalate when any of the following are true:
- no new PASS in the last 90 minutes
- latest 6 collections are all `BLOCK`
- same `report_source` persists across the last 6 eeepc snapshots
- same `failure_class` repeats across recent eeepc cycle events

### 4. Required response to escalation
When stagnation is detected, the system should automatically produce:
- current blocker summary
- trend summary
- what changed since the last good PASS
- the single best next bounded action

### 5. No silent waiting
The system should not assume the operator will remember to ask again.
A scheduled supervisor must proactively review the dashboard state and report.

## Concrete Control Loop

1. collector keeps snapshots flowing into SQLite
2. stagnation script computes latest trend and incident status
3. scheduled supervisor runs on a cadence
4. supervisor reports status and, if needed, recommends or takes the next bounded slice

## Current Implementation Decision

For now, implement:
- a local stagnation analysis script in the dashboard project
- an active remediation candidate generator that reads the same dashboard SQLite state and emits one bounded corrective action without changing anything
- an autonomous cron supervisor that runs periodically and reports to the current chat
- a project-level autonomy registry/runbook that records ownership, escalation thresholds, and execution roles for every active project
- an additional control job that checks ownership drift and review freshness, not just stagnation

This is the minimum viable process change that removes dependence on a manual nudge.
