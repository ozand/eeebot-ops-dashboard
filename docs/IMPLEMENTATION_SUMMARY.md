# Nanobot Ops Dashboard v1 Summary

Status: complete and manually verified on this host.

What exists:
- separate project repo under `Projects/nanobot-ops-dashboard`
- SQLite-backed history retention
- local CLI commands:
  - `init-db`
  - `collect-once`
  - `poll`
  - `serve`
- live eeepc collection over SSH with optional sudo password env
- local repo-side state collection with graceful fallback when workspace-state is absent
- local web UI pages:
  - overview
  - cycles with filter form
  - promotions with filter form
  - approvals
  - deployments
  - analytics with recent snapshots/cycles
  - subagents
- machine-readable endpoints:
  - `/api/summary`
  - `/api/cycles`
  - `/api/promotions`
  - `/api/approvals`
  - `/api/deployments`
- tests for storage, collector, polling, and app rendering

What was manually verified:
- test suite passes
- eeepc live state can be collected into SQLite
- historical snapshots accumulate in `collections`
- local web server starts successfully on `127.0.0.1:8787`
- all pages return HTML and contain expected content
- canonical user services can run the dashboard web UI and collector continuously

Canonical runtime mode now exists:
- `scripts/run_web.sh`
- `scripts/run_collector.sh`
- `scripts/install_user_units.sh`
- `systemd/nanobot-ops-dashboard-web.service`
- `systemd/nanobot-ops-dashboard-collector.service`

Current known limitation:
- durable subagent telemetry is not emitted by Nanobot yet, so the dashboard correctly reports that this data source is unavailable instead of inventing it.
